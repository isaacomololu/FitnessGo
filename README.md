Project Name: FitnessGO
The story:
	This project sprouted from my own journey to gain muscle without access to any equipment or a concrete plan. Initially, I struggled without a clear roadmap, and even when I did establish one, it was challenging to tailor it to my specific needs while juggling time constraints. Enter FitnessGO. When tasked with creating a portfolio project for the Alx Africa program, I decided to develop something that could have truly assisted me during those trying times.
